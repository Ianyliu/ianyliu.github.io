Research conducted during my internship at Wake Forest University, Center for Artificial Intelligence Research.

This paper extends our prior work on harmonized cortical GNNs by incorporating more comprehensive evaluation methods to examine model performance for prediction of Alzheimer's disease risk. The work aims to make deep learning models more transparent and clinically actionable for healthcare practitioners.
