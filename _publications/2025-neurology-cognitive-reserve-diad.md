Research conducted during my internship at Washington University in St. Louis, Institute for Informatics.

The study investigates the role of cognitive reserve in modulating symptom onset and longitudinal cognitive decline in individuals with Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Disease (DIAD). This work contributes to understanding protective factors that may delay clinical manifestation of the disease.
